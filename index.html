      const cards = [{
        title: 'domino',
        waterDetails: `<p>One of the main reasons that the Echinopsis subdenudata is perfect for beginners is that it does not need regular watering, however when its soil becomes dry to the touch you should make sure that the water reaches the roots. Be careful not to leave it in a pool of water tough, as it will affect the health of your cactus and runs the risk of rotting its roots. During its hibernation period, in the winter, it needs even less water than in the growing season.</p>

        <p>Moreover, if you keep your hedgehog cactus outdoor, make sure it has some shelter and is not placed under somewhere where it can soak up all the water from direct rainfall as it will have the same effect as overwatering and might damage it.</p>
        `,
        sunDetails: `
        <p>It should be kept in half shade during the summer, and in full sunlight during the winter – if you need help with some extra warmth or light you can also employ the use of a growing lamp – however, in this case, you should be careful to sync the lamp with the day-light schedule so you don’t weaken it.</p>

        <p>During its growing season, you will be able to help it bloom its famous flowers by ensuring that its surrounding temperature is 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21° Celsius) – this temperature is paramount for the flowers to grow. If instead, you are not interested in the flowers, you can keep it at any temperature.</p>
        `,
        careDetails: `
          <p>During its growing season, you will be able to help it bloom its famous flowers by ensuring that its surrounding temperature is 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21° Celsius) – this temperature is paramount for the flowers to grow. If instead, you are not interested in the flowers, you can keep it at any temperature. They usually bloom during the night and will start wilting away the next day</p>

          <p>If you want to create your own soil mix – drainage is key – so, make sure you have porous soil and add a layer of pebbles and a layer of sand in the pot so the water can escape and provide sufficient air for the roots for proper ventilation.</p>

        }
      }, {
        title: 'rainbow hedgehog',
        waterDetails: `<p>The Rainbow Hedgehog Cactus should be watered only once its soil is dry to the touch. Like many other succulents, this cactus is drought-tolerant and requires little water. One thing to keep in mind with Rainbow Hedgehog Cacti is that they tend to have weak root systems that are very prone to root rot if overwatered.So be careful with how much water you supply to your cactus.</p>
        <p>In winter, water the Rainbow Hedgehog Cactus only once or twice per month, or don’ t water it at all. Dormant in winter, this cactus requires little to no water to survive. </p>`,
        sunDetails: `<p>Echinocereus Rigidissimus Rubrispinus “Rainbow Hedgehog Cactus” grows the best outdoors since it requires plenty of light. In fact, surviving in temperatures down to 20 degrees F (-6.7 degrees C), the Rainbow Hedgehog Cactus is also quite frost-hardy, so it should do good outdoors in winter as well. Indoor growing is also possible with this cactus,
        but it will be a little more challenging due to the cactus’ light needs.</p>`,
        careDetails: `<p>Echinocereus Rigidissimus Rubrispinus “Rainbow Hedgehog Cactus” is a slow-growing cactus, and a steady diet of a fertilizer diluted to 1/4-1/2 strength should allow you to ensure successful growth. Fertilize the plant with a cactus fertilizer in spring and summer once or twice a month, depending on the strength of your fertilizer.</p>

        <p>You probably won’t have to repot the Rainbow Hedgehog Cactus often since it’s a slow grower. Repotting every other spring or summer should do fine. However, given how sensitive the roots of this cactus are, you may want to repot it every year – this will allow you to check on the health of the roots.But when repotting this cactus, be very gentle to avoid damage to the roots.</p>

        }
      }, {
        title: 'bunny ear',
        waterDetails: `<p>During their first season in a new planting container, Bunny Ears cacti need regular watering to maintain the soil constantly damp. When the first inch (2.5 cm) of soil is dry to the touch, it is the perfect time to water your cactus.</p>

        <p>They usually require only occasional watering. Many growers prefer to use a tray under their pot to allow the soil to drain out properly and throw away any excess water. During the autumn and winter, you should water your Bunny Ears cactus only once every three to four weeks. These plants can also do well without watering in winter, but they need immediate watering once the spring shows its warmth.</p>
        `,
        sunDetails: `<p>Like most cacti, they do well in a bright location where they can receive plenty of full sunlight for most of the year. When growing them indoors, you can place your cactus at a south-facing or west-facing window. If you cannot provide your Bunny Ears cactus with enough natural light, these light-feeders can also grow healthy below a white fluorescent tube for at least 14 hours. Keep in mind that you need to move these cacti to a spot with partial sunlight during the winter.</p>

        <p>From late autumn to early spring, provide these cacti with mid-cool temperatures from 10 to 18°C and keep them away from heat sources. If their temperature requirements are not properly met, your Bunny Ears cacti will die off in the following spring.</p>
        `,
        careDetails: `<p>Bunny Ears cacti will benefit from sandy and well-draining soil. Look for a clay pot that has drainage holes and fill it with cacti and succulent potting soil mix. You can also make your own mix from 40% sand, 40% all-purpose potting soil, and 20% peat moss. If you want to improve drainage for a picky Bunny Ears cactus, it is suggested you mix in a 1:1 ratio of bark or perlite.</p>

        <p>They are usually bothered by pests like scale insects and mealybugs. Scale insects will show their presence through a brown scab-like effect on the cactus pads, while mealybugs leave white patches on the stem surface. If you notice any sign of infestation, you can treat your Bunny Ears cactus using a cotton cloth soaked in rubbing alcohol.</p>
        `,

          description: 'A bunny ear cactus'
        }
      }, {
        title: 'peanut',
        waterDetails: `<p>The peanut cactus is drought-tolerant thanks to its fleshy, water-storing stems and is easily susceptible to overwatering. Allow the soil to dry out thoroughly between waterings and then water deeply, soaking the soil completely. Cut back on watering in the winter when the cactus is dormant. Average household humidity and temperature levels are usually fine for the peanut cactus, just avoid placing it in particularly humid locations of the home, such as the bathroom.</p>`,
        sunDetails: `<p>Like most cacti, the peanut cactus grows best in bright, sunny conditions. It can not tolerate being grown in full shade or low-light conditions. When grown outdoors, the peanut cactus should be planted in a full-sun location. In consistently hot climates, this cactus may appreciate some shade to protect it from the intense afternoon sun. When grown indoors, the peanut cactus should be placed in the sunniest location in your house. A bright west- or south-facing window is ideal.</p>`,
        careDetails: `<p>While the peanut cactus cannot tolerate frost, it does require cooler winter temperatures in order to set buds for the following growing season. Healthy peanut cacti will display beautiful red flowers in the late spring to early summer.</p>

        <p>Plastic or terracotta pots are both great choices for the peanut cactus, as long as the pot has a drainage hole to allow excess water to drain out. Since the peanut cactus has a trailing habit as it matures, it also looks great in hanging containers or baskets.</p>
        `,
        image: {
          src: 'peanut.webp',
          description: 'A peanut cactus'
        }
      }, {
        title: 'plumosa "feather"',
        waterDetails: `<p>The key here is to not over water, as any prolonged exposure to excessive dampness will begin to rot the tubercles. We would recommend you let the soil completely dry out in between watering.</p>

        <p>During the winter period, your Feather Cactus will go into a dormant period. At this point, it is important to drastically reduce the amount of water you give it. You can pick up your normal watering schedule in the spring months when the temperatures begin to rise. As long as you water your Feather Cactus every couple of weeks, under-watering should not be a problem. Of course, it is also acceptable to underwater in the winter months.</p>
        `,
        sunDetails: `<p>Mature, adult plants will be very happy to sit in a bright sunny window all day long. In fact, they really need over 6 hours of direct sunlight to thrive and produce flowers. Be careful however of the baby cacti and immature ones. You will need to gradually expose young plants to light. Best to keep younger plants out of the glare.</p>

        <p>Instead, place them somewhere that gets good access to bright indirect sunlight until it reaches the point whereby it can gradually be exposed to more direct sunlight. Once you feel it is ready for more, you can move it to a sunny location and cover it with a few layers of paper. Remove one layer every couple of days, thus increasing the light content only little by little.</p>
        `,
        careDetails: `<p>The main issues you need to look out for are generally disease and pest-free. Having said that, the unique fluffy exterior makes it more vulnerable than others to particular issues – mainly root rot. And if you do get any unwanted pests or guests, they can be hard to spot given the coverage the “feathers” give to the base.</p>

        <p>The main unwelcome pest to appear on your cactus will probably be a mealybug. These annoying insects need to be removed quickly, otherwise they will begin to attack your plant fast. During the later months of the summer and early autumn you may be lucky enough to get a display of the light yellow, pink or cream flowers typical of this plant. And a note on the “dormancy” period during winter.</p>

          description: 'A plumosa "feather" cactus'
        }
      }, {
        title: 'bishops cap',
        waterDetails: `<p>During the summer, these cacti require water only when the soil has dried out completely. The best way to help them accommodate with new environmental conditions is to begin watering sparingly in early spring then slowly increase watering as temperature rises.</p>

        <p>When the winter has settled in, you can skip watering for good at temperatures that range from 5 to 15 °C. If your Bishop’s Cap cacti are exposed to high levels of humidity, they may become tender and eventually die off. To maintain dry air around these plants, you can use a dehumidifier or simply place them in a room with air vents.</p>
        `,
        sunDetails: `<p>Bishop’s Cap cacti can be grown in full sunlight only if you live in a region with cooler climates and a sun that is not too harsh. These cacti thrive in bright and indirect light when they are exposed to it for at least six hours daily. When growing them indoors, place your cacti near south-facing windows and protect them from direct sunlight using sheer curtains.</p>

        <p>Bishop’s Cap cacti do well in slightly cooler to mid-warm temperatures that range from 50 to 68 °F (10-20 °C). They are somehow cold hardy to temperatures that drop to 20 °F (-6.7 °C), but will eventually die off when they are exposed to long periods of frost. In winter, it is better to bring your cacti inside if you grow them outdoors.</p>
        `,
        careDetails: `<p>They will have a great time if planted in soil with excellent drainage and a pot that has drainage holes at the bottom. You can also prepare your own mixture by combining a quarter of coarse sand, a quarter of pumice, and half potting soil. Make sure you protect the neck of your cacti by spreading a layer of sand above the potting mixture you are using.</p>

        <p>Their flowers come in various shades of creamy white, yellow, or violet-pink with their base and center colored in creamy yellow, orange, or red.These spineless cacti have no toxic effects known. They can be grown safely around playful pets and children, although consuming them is not recommended.</p>

        }
      }, {
        title: 'powder puff',
        waterDetails: `<p>A good rule of thumb for all cacti: When in doubt, water less than you think you should. With the powder puff cactus, you want to allow the soil mixture to become completely dry between waterings, soaking it deeply and thoroughly when it comes time to do so. Never let the plant or pot sit in water. Come winter, the cactus will go dormant and all watering can cease; if you notice your powder puff cactus shriveling or appearing to dry out, you can lightly mist it occasionally.</p>`,
        sunDetails: `<p>Though it's considered an easy plant to care for, light availability is by far the most important factor in keeping your powder puff cactus alive. The plant appreciates strong light and will thrive if given several hours of bright sun a day. Keep it on a windowsill in your home that boasts uninterrupted light, or take care to move it around your space throughout the day (or place it outside during the warmer summer months) to make sure it fills its light quota of at least eight hours a day.</p>`,
        careDetails: `<p>Like most cacti, drainage is key when it comes to the soil for the powder puff cactus. Opt for a cactus or succulent soil mixture that incorporates coarse sand or perlite to aid in drainage. Additionally, plant the cactus in a pot with holes at its base to let out excess water—one made from a clay or terracotta material can also assist in wicking up extra moisture.</p>

        <p>During the cactus' summer growing season, feed it with a liquid fertilizer mix specially formulated for succulents or cacti. Be sure to suspend all feeding in the fall and winter as the cactus goes dormant.</p>

      }, {
        title: 'red barrel',
        waterDetails: `<p>The barrel cactus is native to arid desert regions and usually has only rainwater to supply its humidity needs. In summer, you should water your Barrel cactus once per week. The Ferocactus doesn’t need much water in winter when it is dormant, so you can neglect your cactus during the cold months. Adequate watering in spring may encourage the plant to bloom and to reward you with a large yellow flower. If you’re lucky enough, the cactus will produce edible fruit.</p>`,
        sunDetails: `<p>Potted cacti should be kept in a bright sunny location, in the warmest room of your home. However, direct southern sunlight may burn the plant in the really hot summer, so you should move them back from the window or turn on your blinds to diffuse the light. When grown in a garden, make sure they receive enough sunlight. Full to partial sun is optimal for barrel cacti. If you live in a region with warm winters, it is better to grow the Barrel cacti outdoors rather than indoors.</p>`,
        careDetails: `<p>The soil for Ferocactus should contain mainly sand with a little perlite, topsoil, and compost. Store-bought succulent and cacti mixes are a good option when growing barrel cacti indoors. Unglazed pots are best for potted cacti because they allow the evaporation of excess water. When growing barrel cacti outdoors, avoid situations where your plants could sit in water by planting them on heaps. Use long tweezers to remove weeds that grow in the spine net.</p>`,

          src: 'red-barrel.jpg',
          description: 'A red barrel cactus'
        }
      }, {
        title: 'monkey tail',
        waterDetails: `<p>It’s general knowledge that cacti need very little water, as they’ve evolved to live in mainly dry areas. You only need to water these cacti when the soil has completely dried out, not before. You should keep the soil even drier during late fall and winter – during this period, the cactus has to rest (for lack of a better word). It must lay dormant for a few months if you want it to bloom properly.</p>`,
        sunDetails: `<p>This species needs very little light to thrive. They usually need less light than any other plants, and it’s important not to expose them to direct sunlight. As silly as it may sound, too much direct sunlight can actually harm this species. It’s much better to expose it to light, indirect sunlight. You’ll notice quickly that this is much better for them. This allows you to put them in the space in your apartment or house where there’s not much sun, for example, on the shelf next to the TV. You don’t need to focus on areas near windows.</p>`,
        careDetails: `<p>This species is known for its speed in growing. It grows quite rapidly and very vigorously. They’ll usually grow a few feet before they actually start to droop, averaging in between 12 and 18 inches before the droop starts. They can grow to amazing lengths, so make sure that you have enough room for them.</p>

        <p>The perfect conditions are light soil, well-ventilated room with good soil drainage. Meaning sandy and loamy soils are perfect for its growth. The flowers produced by monkey’s tail cactus can grow up to the length of 3 inches! With time, these flowers will transition into red-like, spherical seeds that germinate easily. They usually bloom in spring and summer, as the plant prefers warmer times for blooming. </p>
